It contains a menu and copyright text.

It is common practice to use a list for the menu items:
We have reused our container div to provide the necessary paddings and center alignment.
Each of the menu links are contained in list items.
The copyright text is a simple paragraph.
By default, the list items are styled as a vertical bullet list.

To make the menu list horizontal and remove the bullets, we used list-style: none; for the ul element.
We also set display: inline-block; for the list items to make them inline-level element containers and so they are positioned next to each other horizontally.

The rest of the styles are simple text and background colors, as well as text sizes.
