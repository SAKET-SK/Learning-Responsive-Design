This section contains three features along with an image and text. The features are aligned horizontally next to each other.

We will reuse our container div to wrap all the elements of the features section:
Each feature is wrapped in a div with class "feature", which we will use to position the features.
It contains an image and a paragraph of text.
Right now, they are simply positioned below each other, so we need to add some CSS styles to fix that.
We are using sample image files that we have uploaded to our server.
