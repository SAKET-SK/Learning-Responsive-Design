Here are some of the most common practices to follow when building a responsive web page:
- Use relative units (such as percentages) for the sizes of the elements and fonts.
- Use CSS media queries to define breakpoints and layout changes.
- Define the viewport to adapt to mobile screens.
- Use CSS Flexbox to make it easier to create flexible layouts.
Always test your page using different browser widths; you can resize your browser to see how your page adapts to the new width.
Modern browsers also support emulating a mobile device screen size, which makes it easy to test using predefined widths.
