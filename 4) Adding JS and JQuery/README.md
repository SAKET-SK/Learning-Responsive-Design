A Submenu

Modern websites include interactive elements and animations, which improve the user experience and aesthetics.
Let's add a submenu to our responsive landing page that will open and close when tapping on the Download Now button.
Our submenu will be responsive as well -- it will appear over elements on desktop, and will push down the elements when on mobile.
