<!--We used a header tag for the header, section tags for the features and quote sections, and a footer tag for the footer.
We gave corresponding class names to the features and quote sections so we can define CSS styles for them.
We do not have any CSS styles defined yet, so the sections are just white blocks with dummy text.--!>
