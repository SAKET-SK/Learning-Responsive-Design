Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is the practice of building websites that can adapt to every device and every screen size.

A responsive website is usable on different screen sizes, from large desktops to small mobile screens.
The main concept of responsive web design is building layouts that respond to screen size change by adapting and changing the style of the page.

A landing page is where users land when clicking on promotional/marketing links.
For example, when you want to promote your app, you share its landing page URL on social and other media.
