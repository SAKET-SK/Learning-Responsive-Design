Viewport


Before we start making our landing page responsive, we need to cover a few concepts.
The first concept is the viewport: the visible area of a web page.
Usually, a web page with a fixed width becomes too large to fit the viewport on a small screen, such as a mobile device or tablet. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.
You can control the viewport of your web pages.
